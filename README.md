# Clickinator v1
I was a little mad at a click-speed testing game, so I decided to make an autoclicker to beat it.
End of story...

Features:
- Can theoretically dump up to 10,000 clicks in 20 msec
- Can click indefinitely
- You can decide how long to send clicks for
- Hover anywhere over application window to stop clicking
- Tracks cursor position

Requirements:
- Needs .NET Framework 2.0+ to run
