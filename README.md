# Clickinator v1
I was a little mad at a click-speed testing game, so I decided to make an autoclicker to beat it.
End of story...

Features:
- Can theoretically dump up to 10,000 clicks in 20 msec
- Can click indefinitely
- Hover anywhere over application window to stop clicking
- Tracks cursor position

Requirements:
- Need .NET Framework 2.0+ to run (I mean come on it's been out for 20 years already you should hopefully have it by now :P)

Check out the development process on YouTube!
Here I share some of the issues with using Windows API in C#, and I demonstrate the finished application: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfhzbRKDrrStWgWaJeMtIwSQuwEuNAj32
